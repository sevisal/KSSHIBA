# KSSHIBA

Here we present the algorithm Kernelized observations SSHIBA (KSSHIBA) with some examples in which it can be used. In particular, we included a notebook to develop the functioning of the algorithm in different contexts, using different versions of the algorithm for each of them.

The main goal is to explain the usage of the method as well as showing some results with different databases.
